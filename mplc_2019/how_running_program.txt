
HELLO :-) :-) :-)

FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS TO SAVE MPLC_2019 ON HARD DISK 

TO HAVE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT PROBLEM TACKLE OUR MODEL, PLEASE HAVE A LOOK TO: 'model_description.docx'

DONWLOADING ANACONDA FOR PYTHON

1-- go to www.anaconda.com, donwload and install anaconda (choose python 3.7).

INSTALL NEEDING MISSING PACKAGES
 
1-- tape on windows search bar 'anaconda prompt' and run it.
2-- we have to install pytorch and torchvision
3-- to install pytorch and torchvision,
  copy this command: conda install -c pytorch torchvision 
  paste it in anaconda command prompt and run it .

TO SEE CODE SOURCE OF OUR MODEL

1-- run anaconda
2-- launch spyder
3-- makes left click on 'open file symbol' located at upper left end of spyder's window. then go to 'mplc_2019' folder and choose 'Malaria-convnets.py'. it should open.  
4-- then we can see source code of model and we can run (tap run buttton at the top of window) it for fun. But program take at least 4h for training. We can see performance model on powerpoint file name 'model_training-result.pptx'.  
5-- we have also train program and save its parameters on file name 'save_params' contented in mplc_2019 file. then we can do fast prediction on some image of test set.
 So in spyder open file name 'test.py' and run it . it give prediction of 100 random images of test set.  :-) :-) :-)
